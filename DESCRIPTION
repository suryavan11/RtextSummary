Description: Build a text summary by extracting relevant sentences from your text. The training dataset should consist of several documents, each document should have sentences separated by a period. While fitting the model, glove word vectors and tfidf are calculated at the document level. While applying the model on new data, an l2-norm of tfidf-weighted average of glove word vectors for each sentence is calculated. The output can be either at the sentence level (sentences and weights are returned) or at a document level (the summary for each document is returned). It is useful to first get a sentence level output and plot a histogram of the sentence weights to determine a cutoff threshold for the weights. This threshold can then be used in the document level output. This method is a variation of the tfidf extractive summarization method mentioned in a review paper by Gupta (2010) <doi:10.4304/jetwi.2.3.258-268>.
